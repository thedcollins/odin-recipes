    <p>GARNISH</p>
    <ul>

        <li>3/4 cup fresh blueberries</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
    <p>BLACKBERRY JAM</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the blackberries in a medium-sized pot over medium heat, 
            stirring every few minutes until they break apart. Lower the 
            heat and allow the mixture to simmer for 15 minutes. Remove 2 
            teaspoons of the blackberry reduction mixture and set it aside. 
            Stir in the sugar and honey and allow the blackberry jam mixture 
            to continue simmering over low heat for 45 minutes, stirring every 
            8 minutes or so. Remove from heat, stir in the lemon juice, zest, 
            and cardamom, and allow to cool to room temperature then refrigerate.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>CARDAMOM PAVLOVA</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 300 degrees Fahrenheit. In the bowl of an electric 
            stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat the egg whites until 
            they hold soft peaks. Gradually beat in the sugar, about 1/4 cup at a 
            time. Continue beating on high speed until the egg whites are shiny, 
            thick, and hold stiff peaks, then fold in the vanilla extract and the 
            ground cardamom.</li>

        <li>Trace a 9-inch circle on a piece of parchment paper, then flip it upside 
            down and place it on a baking sheet down so the traced side won't touch 
            the meringue. Lift up each corner of the parchment paper and dab a small 
            teaspoon-sized blob of meringue on the corner of a large baking sheet, 
            then press the parchment paper back down firmly onto the bit of meringue 
            (doing this on each of the four corners of the baking sheet will keep the 
            parchment paper from sliding around while you spread your pavlova shape).</li>

        <li>Using a rubber spatula, spread the remaining meringue into a 9-inch circle 
            shape using the tracing to guide you. Try to make the edges of the pavlova 
            slightly higher than the center to allow space for the toppings later on. 
            Use an offset spatula to make vertical lines around the edge of the pavlova, 
            starting your offset spatula at the bottom of the pavlova and then lifting 
            straight up, and repeating all the way around the edges of the pavlova 
            (optional).</li>

        <li>Place the pan in the oven and bake for 1 hour to 1 hour and 15 minutes, 
            or until the meringue is crisp on the outside and easily lifts off the 
            parchment. Turn off the oven and allow the pavlova to cool to room 
            temperature over several hours. Pavlovas will deflate and collapse 
            if cooled too quickly. Once cooled, remove the pavlova from the oven.</li>

        <li>If your pavlova has cracks, do not fret. If any part looks like it may 
            crack off after cooling, just gently press it back into place (the 
            toppings will help hide any large cracks on the top).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>BLACKBERRY WHIPPED CREAM</p>
    <ol>
        <li>To make the whipped cream, beat whipping cream, sugar and cardamom 
            until lightly fluffy and smooth and holds soft peaks. Then add lemon 
            zest, blackberry reduction and vanilla and beat on low speed until 
            it's combined thoroughly but be careful to not over beat!</li>
    </ol>
    <p>GARNISH</p>
    <ol>
        <li>To assemble the pavlova, place the pavlova on a serving plate. 
            Spread the blackberry whipped cream on top of it, then the blackberry 
            jam. To garnish, arrange some of the fresh blackberries and blueberries 
            on top and drizzle with the honey. Serve immediately and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
