        <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>

        <li>1 cup shelled pistachios</li>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter room temperature</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups powdered sugar</li>

        <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/3 cup finely chopped pistachios for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
    <p>HONEY ORANGE BLOSSOM SYRUP</p>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small saucepan, bring the honey, sugar, and water to a boil over 
            medium high heat. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes, then 
            remove from heat and allow to cool until warm, then stir in orange 
            blossom water. You can use more or less of the orange blossom water 
            in the recipe depending on the strength of the brand you have. I used 
            Nielsen Massey brand, but the flavor concentration can vary depending 
            on the brand you have, so giving the syrup a taste and adjusting to your 
            personal flavor preference is a good idea.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>HONEY ORANGE BLOSSOM CAKE</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Grease (3) 8-inch cake pans 
            and line the bottoms with parchment paper. Set aside.</li>

        <li>In a large bowl, mix together the flour, almond meal, baking powder, 
            cardamom, baking soda, and salt. Set it aside.</li>

        <li>In the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, 
            beat together the butter and sugar at medium speed until smooth and fluffy, 
            about 1 minute. Add the eggs, 1 at a time, waiting until the egg is fully 
            incorporated into the batter before adding the next one. Add the honey and 
            mix to combine.</li>

        <li>With the mixer running at low speed, alternate between adding the flour 
            mixture and the buttermilk in 4 increments until combined. Stir in the 
            vanilla extract, orange blossom water, and orange zest. Evenly distribute 
            the batter between the cake pans and place them in the oven. Bake until 
            golden around edges, lightly golden on top, and a toothpick inserted 
            into the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes.</li>

        <li>Allow the cakes to cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then poke top the top 
            of each cake 1 dozen times with a fork pour, and drizzle the syrup evenly 
            over the three cakes. Allow the cakes to cool to room temperature and absorb 
            the syrup, then flip them out onto a wire rack and allow them to continue 
            to cool while you prepare the buttercream.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>PISTACHIO BUTTERCREAM + ASSEMBLY</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the shelled pistachios in a food processor and blend until creamy 
            and smooth (like a thick peanut butter in texture), about 1 minute. Set 
            the pistachio butter aside.</li>

        <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the 
            butter at medium speed until utter until pale and smooth, about 1 minute. 
            Add the pistachio butter and beat until incorporated. Then add the powdered 
            sugar and beat at low speed until combined, then add the milk and salt and 
            raise the speed to medium and beat until light and fluffy, about 2 to 4 minutes.</li>

        <li>To assemble: layer and frost the cake with the pistachio buttercream. To 
            create the round icing decorations around the top edge of the cake, use a 
            pastry bag with a large round tip and follow the icing method in this 
            video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl24VWJZFMI</li>

        <li>Sprinkle the finely chopped pistachios around the lowest inch of the icing 
            around the bottom edge of the cake. Sprinkle any excess chopped pistachios on 
            top, and serve.</li>
    </ol>
