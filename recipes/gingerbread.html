    <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. To make the 
            gingerbread as pictured, use this tree-shaped baking pan 
            https://www.nordicware.com/products/evergreen-cakelet-pan/. 
            You can also use two 8-inch cake pans, greased and lined with 
            parchment paper round on the bottom. Alternately, you can use 
            a small 6-cup capacity bundt pan. Set your preferred pan(s) aside.</li>

        <li>In a large bowl, stir together the flour, cinnamon, dried ginger, 
            allspice, nutmeg, cloves, cardamom, baking soda, baking powder, 
            and salt until combined. Set aside.</li>

        <li>In the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, 
            beat together the butter and brown sugar at medium-low speed until smooth 
            and combined, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed. 
            Reduce the speed to low and add the eggs 1 at a time, waiting until each 
            egg is incorporated before adding the next one. Add the molasses and mix 
            until combined, then add the ginger, lemon zest, and vanilla and mix until 
            incorporated. With the mixer running at low speed, alternate between adding 
            the  buttermilk and flour mixture in three increments, mixing until *just* 
            combined (do not overmix).</li>

        <li>If using the tree-shaped baking pan, spray it with cooking oil and dust with 
            almond flour before filling the tree molds 3/4 full with batter (it will 
            puff up when baking and rise to fill the mold). The recipe makes 12 of the 
            tree cakes, so you will need to use the pan twice. If using the 6-cup capacity 
            bundt pan, spray it with cooking oil and dust with almond flour before adding 
            the batter to the pan. If using two 8-inch cake pans, evenly distribute the 
            batter between the two greased and lined cake pans.</li>

        <li>Bake at 350 degrees until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake 
            comes out clean, which is about 20 to 25 minutes for the tree-shaped baking 
            pan. The cooking time will vary depending on the cooking pan you use—basically 
            the larger the pan, the longer the bake time—so keep an eye on your gingerbread 
            and take it out of the oven when a toothpick inserted into the center comes out 
            clean.</li>

        <li>Remove from the oven and place the pan on a wire rack to cool for 10 minutes 
            before gently unmolding the cake onto the wire rack to cool completely. 
            Dust with powdered sugar and serve. Will keep for up to 4 days in an airtight 
            container in the refrigerator.</li>
    </ol>
